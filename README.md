Each day will be carried by one trainer and you will be able to find the material associated with each Day in the corresponding directory.

## Day 1 - Fundamentals of scRNA-seq 
**_Trainer:_** Miguel Santos, Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine\
This day, you will be introduced to the single cell RNAseq technology (scRNAseq) as well as their general means to analyse the raw data generated by the sequencers to the count matrices. We will also help you te set up your working environment.

## Day 2 - MUSCAT and MiloDE
**_Trainer:_** Helena Crowell, Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico\
This day, you will learn how to integrate several dataset together to find a common space in which the different cells type can be understood with a common ground.

## Day 3 - MOFA
**_Trainer:_** Francisca Gaspar Vieira, Heidelberg University & EMBL-EBI \
This day, you will learn how to integrate several dataset together to find a common space in which the different cells type can be understood with a common ground.

## Day 4 -  Cell-cell communication
**_Trainer:_** Tomás Gomes, Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine \
This day, you will learn how to integrate several dataset together to find a common space in which the different cells type can be understood with a common ground.

## Day 5 -  Analysis Time and Presentations
This day, you will learn how to integrate several dataset together to find a common space in which the different cells type can be understood with a common ground.
