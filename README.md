# 2025-Autumn-School-for-Single-Cell-ers

Official Code repository for the "Autumn School for Single Cell-ers" Workshop at GIMM

Each day will be carried by one trainer and you will be able to find the material associated with each Day in the corresponding directory.

## Day 1 - Fundamentals of scRNA-seq 
**_Instructor:_** Miguel Santos, Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine\
You’ll be introduced to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, covering the key principles and workflows involved in processing raw sequencing data into count matrices, and downstream analysis for the identification of cell types. We’ll also guide you through setting up your working environment for the week. In case we have time, there is also a small tutorial on batch integration. 

At the end of the day, we will have a dedicated session for group formation and dataset preparation. During this time, you will choose a dataset to work on throughout the week.

## Day 2 - MUSCAT and MiloDE
**_Instructor:_** Helena Crowell, Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico\
In the morning, you’ll explore MUSCAT, a powerful tool for multi-sample differential expression analysis. In the afternoon, you’ll be introduced to MiloDE, a framework for differential expression testing that complements MUSCAT.

## Day 3 - MOFA
**_Instructor:_** Francisca Gaspar Vieira, Heidelberg University & EMBL-EBI \
This session will focus on MOFA, a statistical framework designed for the integration of multiple data modalities and groups of samples. You’ll learn how to apply MOFA to uncover shared and unique biological signals across datasets.

The data for the practical tutorial is available in the following link: https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/ceaf2baade004a1f8af3/

## Day 4 -  Cell-cell communication
**_Instructor:_** Tomás Gomes, Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine \
You’ll dive into computational approaches for studying cell–cell communication in single-cell data, exploring key tools and strategies to identify and interpret intercellular signaling patterns.

## Day 5 -  Analysis Time and Presentations
The final day is dedicated to independent analysis and team presentations. Participants will showcase their results, analytical strategies, and insights gained throughout the workshop.
