# Installing Tutorials

This Tutorial have been put together by Jean-Christophe LONE.

In this tutorial we will provide help to install R and Rstudio.

## Installing R and Rstudio

### R from CRAN Download from CRAN 

You will need to install `R`, the required `R` libraries, and download the codebase. It is crucial to complete this before the Workshop starts to avoid unnecessary delays. Please follow the installation instructions provided below.

If you are new to `R`, the best option is to install it from the CRAN Website: 
```
https://cran.r-project.org/
```

There, you can find installers for your operating system (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is similar to a magic box of tools for solving puzzles. These puzzles could be anything from math problems to understanding data from a science experiment. R is a special computer language that helps you use these tools to work on different projects. Just like you might have different kinds of toys for different games, R has different tools and packages for different kinds of data puzzles.

### Rstudio as IDE from Posit

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) includes a text editor and various tools to debug and interpret complex code. Think of `R` as the engine of a car, and the IDE as the components that make using the engine easier (like the wheels, seat, or radio).

We recommend using RStudio for this workshop:

However, feel free to use the software you are most comfortable with. `Visual Studio Code` (`VSCode`) or `Jupyter Notebook` are also good options.

Now, imagine RStudio as your super organized toy room where you can easily find and use all the tools from your R magic box. RStudio helps you keep everything in one place, making it easier to write code, see results, and keep track of your projects. It's like having a special desk where you can draw, build, and create, with all your favorite supplies right at your fingertips. With RStudio, using R becomes much more fun and easy, just like playing in your perfect toy room!
